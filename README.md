## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I go by Timbits online, but occasionally I'll also go by T1mbits.<br>
Very good at talking for hours but saying absolutely nothing at the same time. Check out my "[blog](https://t1mbits.github.io/blog)" if you want to see what I'm working on or possibly thinking about (rare occurance)

I mostly program in ðŸ¦€ Rust because I'm too lazy to learn any other language.

- ðŸ”­ Not really working on anything serious right now, but I occasionally work on a custom [multi-dimensional minesweeper engine](https://github.com/T1mbits/hypersweeper)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [iamtimbits](https://discord.com/users/841076895281709116) on Discord
