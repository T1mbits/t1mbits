## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I go by Timbits online, but occasionally I'll also go by T1mbits.<br>
Very good at talking for hours but saying absolutely nothing at the same time. Check out my "[blog](https://t1mbits.github.io/blog)" if you want to see what I'm working on or possibly thinking about (rare occurance)

I ~~mostly~~ only program in ðŸ¦€ Rust, because I'm too lazy to learn any other language.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently "working" on [Rain Meadow](https://github.com/henpemaz/Rain-Meadow) and hypersweeper
-  ðŸ’¬ Ask me about literally anything honestly, I'll probably have an answer
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: iamtimbits @[Discord](https://discord.com)
